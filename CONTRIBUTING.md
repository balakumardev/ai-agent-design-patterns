## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and small

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new patterns
- Include clear examples and use cases
- Provide comprehensive docstrings
- Update any relevant documentation

### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test error handling and edge cases

## 🏗️ Adding New Patterns

If you want to add a new agent design pattern:

1. **Create Pattern Directory**
   ```
   09-your-pattern-name/
   ├── README.md
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── example.py
   ├── your_pattern.py
   └── test_your_pattern.py
   ```

2. **Required Files**
   - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the pattern
   - `requirements.txt`: Pattern-specific dependencies
   - `example.py`: Interactive demonstration
   - `your_pattern.py`: Core implementation
   - `test_your_pattern.py`: Comprehensive tests

3. **Pattern Structure**
   - Follow the existing pattern structure
   - Include clear class definitions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add logging and monitoring

4. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Explain the pattern's purpose and use cases
   - Provide code examples
   - Include performance considerations
   - Document any limitations

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
- Use pytest for all tests
- Organize tests logically
- Include setup and teardown as needed
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Coverage
- Test all public methods
- Include error conditions
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Verify expected outputs

### Example Test Structure
```python
import pytest
from your_pattern import YourPattern

class TestYourPattern:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures before each test method."""
        self.pattern = YourPattern()
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test basic pattern functionality."""
        result = self.pattern.execute("test input")
        assert result is not None
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test error handling."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            self.pattern.execute(None)
```
